# Front-End Case Study: Following the Roadmap.sh Path

This repository contains a collection of frontend projects I've built based on the Frontend Roadmap from roadmap.sh! I will continuously update this repository with new projects as I progress in my learning journey. The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process, sharpen my coding skills, and build a portfolio of frontend projects.
